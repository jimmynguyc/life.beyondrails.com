>  I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be.

Measurement is essential to progress and improvement. Imagine being inside a pitch-black room and asked to walk towards the door. Without knowing where you stand right now, at worst you'd be frozen in place and afraid to move forward. At best you'd be progressing very slowly and cautiously, constantly trying to check if there's a bump on the floor or an obstacle in your path.

A lot of teams forgo measurement because they fear they are measuring the wrong things. I feel that this is a misguided approach; like everything else in the universe, change will happen. It is better to start measuring *something* and then finding out that the measurement needs to be changed, rather than not doing any measurements at all. The act of measuring is in itself an act of learning and that, at the very least, is something of value.

## Measure to Improve, not to Reward or Punish

Ask yourself this: why do I want to measure performance?

Many of the managers and entrepreneurs I've talked to want to measure performance because they want to:

  * have the guarantee that their employees are working
  * pay salaries or compensation accordingly
  * calculate bonuses
  * find out who is under-performing

I feel that this mindset is from a perspective of distrust, and using a measurement to strike fear in the hearts of your team. Worse, you'll only get people to "game the system" by only focusing on the metrics that you have set, instead of the overall improvement of the company.

The correct mindset is to approach this with the intention of having the team improve itself. When the team knows where they stand, they also know where else they can go and how to become better. Better yet, they become [internally motivated][1] to improve themselves and in return you get to reap the benefits.

## What to Measure

There really are only two important things you want to measure in your team: effectiveness and efficiency.

### Effectiveness
is the raw output,

### efficiency

is a multiplier. It does not contribute to the results directly, but it multiplies whatever potential output there is.

### Effectiveness &times; Efficiency = Results
You want to increase both; increasing just one or the other is like a multiplication equation. 2 x 10 = 20 and 2 x 11 = 22 but 3 x 100 = 300

## What NOT to Measure

  * Hours in the office (instead of actual work done)
  * Lines of code (instead of feature impact)
  * Meetings attended (instead of valuable contribution)

... you get the idea. There are many measures that even big companies are implementing, but do not apply to knowledge workers (like your tech team).

As Dan Pink in this [TED Talk][1] mentioned, carrots and sticks (extrinsic motivators) worked fine for many kinds of Industrial Age tasks. But for the Information Age (especially with software development) where there aren't any simple rules and clear goals, these measurements are simply too narrow and restrictive. By measuring these, you're practically telling your team that "I'm only interested in the number of hours I see you in the office."

Measure results, not activity. That way, your team can exercise their creativity at reaching the results, instead of being constrained with the specific activities you only *think* will get you to that result.

## How to Measure

It is extremely seductive to think that by assigning numbers to particular activities, you get to manipulate the results like levers on a control panel.

this is a humanistic approach, so hard numbers won't be able to capture everything immediately. but as you go along with the measurements you'll eventually end up adding more perspectives/sides of the cube to more completely see a more holistic picture

### Ask them what have they done, what are they going to do, and is there anything that's preventing them from doing it

This is a measure of **Effectiveness**. These [three questions][2] are mostly used by Scrum methodology, but you don't have to practice the whole of Scrum to take advantage of this approach. The three questions allows your team to:

  * commit to each other on a task
  * find out how much progress has been made on a particular area
  * improve communication with each other
  * nip possible problems in the bud

the danger is this meeting being a status update where the boss starts asking questions on why a particular workset is not yet done. again this is not for your benefit but for the team's so they know what each other is working on

### Ask the team to rate their feelings for the last week

This is a measure of **Efficiency**. Most of the time we forget that we're hiring people, not robots. They have feelings and emotions, and these are important indicators of possible issues that are hiding beneath the surface.

You can use techniques like [Glad-Sad-Mad][3], [Stop-Start-Continue-More of-Less of][4], or assigning a numerical score and asking what would make the team member give the week a full 10.

You might encounter some push-back, however. When I first introduced the rating of feelings to my team, there was an initial hesitation. Some team mates jokingly mocked the activity as "feelings time" and were uncomfortable sharing what they felt during the week. Some complained that it's yet another waste of time for a meeting, and that it would only devolve into meaningless chatter. These are all valid points, and I had to take them into consideration when I persuaded them to just try it out for a month. I promised to that we'll drop the whole activity if we found that it didn't add any value to our team.

In the end we did find a lot of value for the activity. We managed to:

  * unearth certain issues that were personally affecting individual team members (burn-out, work dissatisfaction, family matters)
  * address concerns on team dynamics (teamwork, communication style)
  * understand each other better
  * have a more tightly-knit and bonded team

We kept the activity, and although some team members still don't want to talk about feelings, we just named the activity to "Sprint Score" but it's effectively the same thing.

### Ask the team to map out the road-map to your milestone

This is a measure of Results.

Your team are the domain experts and are the best people to tell you how long a particular feature will take.


## Conclusion

You might notice you have to ask a lot of things instead of objectively measuring things. This requires a very mature team that you can trust. You might need to work on trust issues first before you can even start meausring performance.

you can only model what you undersstand. assigning numbers is modeling.

Remeber that you are also part of the team, and their performance is also your performance as their leader.
