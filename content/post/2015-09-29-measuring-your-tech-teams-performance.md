title: "Measuring Your Tech Team's Performance"
---
First ask yourself why do you want to measure it?

If you want to measure it so you can have the guarantee that your employees are working, or so that you can pay salaries accordingly, then you're aproaching this from a perspective of distrust. and this isn't gonna work.

the correct mindset is to approach this with the intention of having the team improve itself by being able to know where they stand, so they can become better.

approach this from the perspective of improving things, not as a post but a pre (4dx)

this is a humanistic approach, so hard numbers won't be able to capture everything immediately. but as you go along with the measurements you'll eventually end up adding more perspectives/sides of the cube to more completely see a more wholistic picture

it's not just to your benefit that the performance is being measured. it's the team's benefit, because they become aware of their own state and level and they become motivated internally to perform better. much better than if you force them to. internal motivation vs caroot and stick

# What to measure

There really are only two things you want to measure in your team: effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness is the raw output, and efficiency is a multiplier. You want to increase both; increasing just one or the other is like a multiplication equation. 2 x 10 = 20 and 2 x 11 = 22 but 3 x 100 = 300

# How to measure

## Ask them what have they done, what are they going to do, and is there anything that's preventing them from doing it

This is taken from scrum methodology, but you don't have to practice the whole of scrum to take advantage of this approach. Ask your team every day to commit to each other everyday on a task.

the danger is this meeting being a status update where the boss starts asking questions on why a particular workset is not yet done. again this is not for your benefit but for the team's so they know what each other is working on

## Ask the team to rate their feelings for the last week

Most of the time we forget that we're hiring people, not robots. They have feelings and emotions, and these are important indicators of possible issues that are hiding beneath the surface.

You can use a few techniques like glad sad mad, or assign a numerical score and give an explanation why they gave that score.

yuo might find some pushback frmo the team members. wheni first introuced this to my team, they all complained and mocked "feelings" I persuaded them to try it for a month anyway and we'll drop it if we don't find any value. Iwe did find a lot of value for it, although they still don't want to talk about feelings so we just renamed it to sprint score but it's effectively the same.

## Ask the team to map out the roadmap to your milestone

Your team are the domain experts and are the best people to tell you how long a particular feature will take.


# Conclusion

You might notice you have to ask a lot of things instead of objectively measuring things. This requires a very mature team that you can trust. You might need to work on trust issues first before you can even start meausring performance.

you can only model what you undersstand. assigning numbers is modeling.

Remeber that you are also part of the team, and their performance is also your performance as their leader.
